> _"What's better than a skilled craftsman? A skilled craftsman with the tools to see his dream to fruition."_ - probably said some monk somewhere.

Point is, you gotta use the right tools for the job. It is the 21st century now, and software tools out there have come a long ways. Like seriously, it seems everything now-a-days has a freaking AI in it. Why use outdated tools like _vim_ (I'm looking at you Luke) when you can get state-of-the-art tools for **free** as a student.

So ya, here's a recommend list of software tools (and how to set them up). You don't _have_ to use them if you really don't want to, but all I have to say to that is... why?

- [General Tools]()
- [Electrical Tools]()
  - [AutoCAD]()
- [Software Tools]()

## General Tools
These aren't specific to doing any one particular thing, just a mixed-bag of generally gooder tools that'll hopefully make your life easier.

### Windows Terminal

## Electrical Tools
Tools for harness drawing, PCB design, and all other _zappy-zappy_ stuff.

### AutoCAD
AutoCAD has 2 versions of their software:
1. Desktop Application (for Windows and MacOS)
2. Web-based Application

Regardless of which you pick to use, you'll need to create a _free_ student account for AutoDesk. Head over to [autodesk.com/education/edu-software](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software) to get that all sorted out.
