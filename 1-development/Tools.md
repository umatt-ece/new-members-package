> _"What's better than a skilled craftsman? A skilled craftsman with the tools to see his dream to fruition."_ - probably said some monk somewhere.

Point is, you gotta use the right tools for the job. It is the 21st century now, and software tools out there have come a long ways. Like seriously, it seems everything now-a-days has a freaking AI in it. Why use outdated tools like _vim_ (I'm looking at you Luke) when you can get state-of-the-art tools for **free** as a student.

So ya, here's a recommend list of software tools (and how to set them up). You don't _have_ to use them if you really don't want to, but all I have to say to that is... why?

## Table of Contents
**1** [General Tools]()  
**1.1** Windows Terminal()  
**2** [Electrical Tools]()  
**2.1** [AutoCAD]()  
**3** [Software Tools]()  
**3.1** [JetBrains ToolBox]()  

## 1 General Tools
These aren't specific to doing any one particular thing, just a mixed-bag of generally gooder tools that'll hopefully make your life easier.

### 1.1 Windows Terminal
If you're on Windows, you'll definitely want ot invest in an improved terminal experience (ngl the built-in _command prompt_ is pretty janky). You can download **[Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US)** directly from the Microsoft App Store.

## 2 Electrical Tools
Tools for harness drawing, PCB design, and all other _zappy-zappy_ sorts of stuff.

#### AutoDesk Account
For a lot of our electrical tools, you'll need a license for use AutoDesk software applications. You can get a _free_ student account by heading over to [autodesk.com/education/edu-software](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software). Create an account, fill out your student info, and you then you should be set to go!

### 2.1 AutoCAD
> **Purpose:** Harnessing design

AutoCAD has 2 versions of their software:
1. Desktop Application (for Windows and MacOS)
2. Web-based Application

### 2.2 Fusion 360
> **Purpose:** Printed Circuit Board (or PCB) design.

#### Installation
You can install **Fusion 360** by hopping over to [autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview) and selecting "Fusion 360" from the listed software. Download the _Fusion 360 Client Downloader.exe_ and go ahead and run that. Follow the installer prompts (don't worry, it's really quite simple) and soon enough you'll ready to start designing PCBs.

If you come across soemthing about "join or create a team", don't worry about it for the moment. In the future we may try to get a UMATT team set up, but for the moment we are just using [GitHub](https://github.com/umatt-ece/pcb-design) in order to keep track of files and versioning.
