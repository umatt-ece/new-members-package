# New Members Package 2023-2024

Welcome to the University of Manitoba's Accociation for Tiny Tractors (UMATT) software team! This repository will get you started with everything you need to know in order to be able to meaningfully contribute to the team. We look forward to your hard work in the months to come, and hope you stick around long enough to see the fruits of your labour. If you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out:

**Software Lead:** Kameron Ronald (_ronaldk1@myumanitoba.ca_)


## Ok, but where do I start?
But before we get started, I'd like to take a minute provide you with a bit of a road-map of where we're going.

> **Aside:** This new members package covers a lot of ground, likely some of it you may already know. Feel free to skim over some of the suplimentary information if you feel you have a good grasp on the topic. That said, this package is not exhaustive, and there may be a few gaps here in there. Remember, ***the Internet is your friend***. If you don't understand something, google it, check StackOverflow, find a YouTube video, or ask ChatGPT. If you really get stuck you can always reach out to a member of the team, but learning how to find answers on your own is an invaluable skill in industry. We've all been there when you get thrown head-first into a project you know nothing about and feel like your drowning in the overwhelming amount of knowledge you don't have. Just hang in there and take it one uncommented line of code or shitty datasheet at a time
