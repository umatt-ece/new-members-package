# Development Tools
> _"What's better than a skilled craftsman? A skilled craftsman with the tools to see his dream to fruition."_ - probably said some monk somewhere.

Point is, you gotta use the right tools for the job. It is the 21st century now, and software tools out there have come a long ways. Like seriously, it seems everything now-a-days has a freaking AI in it. Why use outdated tools like _vim_ (I'm looking at you Luke) when you can get state-of-the-art tools for **free** as a student.

So ya, here's a recommend list of software tools (and how to set them up). You don't _have_ to use them if you really don't want to, but all I have to say to that is... why?

**2** [Electrical Tools]()  
**2.1** [AutoCAD]()  
**3** [Software Tools]()  
**3.1** [JetBrains ToolBox]()  

## 1 General Tools
These aren't specific to doing any one particular thing, just a mixed-bag of generally gooder tools that'll hopefully make your life easier.

### 1.1 Windows Terminal
If you're on Windows, you'll definitely want ot invest in an improved terminal experience (ngl the built-in _command prompt_ is pretty janky). You can download **[Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US)** directly from the Microsoft App Store.

## 2 Electrical Tools
Tools for harness drawing, PCB design, and all other _zappy-zappy_ sorts of stuff.

#### AutoDesk Account
In order to use AutoDesk software tools (ie. Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or AutoDesk Eagle), you'll need a license. For the very low price of _free_ you can get a license by signing up for a student account. Just head over to [autodesk.com/education/edu-software](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software). Create an account, fill out your student info, and you then you should be set to go!

#### Altium Account
In order to use Altium software tools (ie. Altium Designer), you'll need a license. As fortune would have it, aquiring a _free_ student license is relativel easy. Just head over to [altium.com/education/student-licenses](https://www.altium.com/education/student-licenses) and sign-up using your student email and other required info. Once submitted, you should receive an email shortly - follow the link to verify your account. _Viola_! You're all set to go.

> **Note:** Once your account has been verified, you should get a separate email with your actual licensing information. This will include import stuff like your _license number_, _activation code_, as well as the _start date_ and _end date_ for your license. Useful stuff, and not a bad idea to keep handy.

_Altium 365_ (wow, real original name Altium) is a cloud-based file sharing service offered by Altium. We do keep a copy of all our files here on GitHub, but Altium 365 is a convenient way for us to share files or switch between workstations easily. In order to join the UMATT workspace, reach out to your Team Lead with your ALtium account email and we'll get you added.

### 2.1 AutoCAD
> **Purpose:** Harnessing design

AutoCAD has 2 versions of their software:
1. Desktop Application (for Windows and MacOS)
2. Web-based Application

### 2.2 Fusion 360
> **Purpose:** Multi-purpose CAD design. Printed Circuit Board (or PCB) design.

#### Installation
You can install **Fusion 360** by hopping over to [autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview) and selecting "Fusion 360" from the listed software. Download the _Fusion 360 Client Downloader.exe_ and go ahead and run that. Follow the installer prompts (don't worry, it's really quite simple) and soon enough you'll ready to start designing PCBs.

If you come across soemthing about "join or create a team", don't worry about it for the moment. In the future we may try to get a UMATT team set up, but for the moment we are just using [GitHub](https://github.com/umatt-ece/pcb-design) in order to keep track of files and versioning.

#### Getting Started
AutoDesk has some really great online resources to jump-start your Fusion 360 experience. You can check out some of their courses over at [autodesk.com/certification/learn/catalog](https://www.autodesk.com/certification/learn/catalog). If you're not sure where to start, I recommend going through the following tuorials/courses to get you up to speed with PCB design.

- [ ] [Learn Fusion 360 in 90 Minutes](https://www.autodesk.com/certification/learn/course/learn-fusion-360-in-90-minutes). 

### 2.3 Altium Designer
> **Purpose:** Printed Circuit Board (or PCB) design.

#### Installation
You can find the installer for **Altium Designer** over at [altium.com/products/downloads](https://www.altium.com/products/downloads). Once there, look for "Altium Designer" and click the download link on the right-hand side of the page. Downloading the installer can be a bit of a pain, as it will require you to sign in to access the file (and unfortunately you can't just sign in with your "student account"). To get around this, you can do one of the following: **1)** create a free Altium account, **2)** download the "free trial", or **3)** if you don't care about having the latest version, you can use the installer file `AltiumDesignerSetup_x_x_x.exe` found in the _resurces_ folder. Once you hath aquired an installer file, run it and follow the prompts. It'll ask you to sign in, and here make sure you use your _student account_ (if you made a free account in _option 1_... don't use that one, use your student one which has the license linked to it).

#### Getting Started
Altium has a lot of great resources for getting started with PCB design. It even
