# New Members Package 2023-2024

## Welcome to the team!
Welcome to the University of Manitoba's Association of Tiny Tractors (UMATT) electrical/software team! This package should get you started with everything you need to know in order to be able to meaningfully contribute to the team. We look forward to your hard work in the months to come, and hope you stick around long enough to see the fruits of your labour. If you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.


## Who are we?
UMATT is team of Engineering, Agriculture, and Computer Science students that come together to build a quarter-scale tractor, and have a blast doing it. Every year we take our tractor to the annual ASABE 1/4 Scale Tractor Student Design Competition in Peoria, IL. There, we compete in tractor pulls and other events intended to test the limits of our design work. Additionally, through written reports and verbal presentations our design is evaluated by a panel of judges from actual industry. It's a great way to get hands-on experience, learn a lot, and make some friends along the way.

**Software Lead:** Kameron Ronald (_ronaldk1@myumanitoba.ca_)


## Ok, but where do I start?
Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute provide you with a bit of a road-map of where things are going. In order to actually join the team, there's a few things you'll need to complete:

- [ ] All team members are required to ....
- [ ] Competition requires that all members be a part of the American Society of Agriculture and Biological Engineers (ASABE). Undergraduate membership is free, and you can sign up by going to [https://www.asabe.org/join](https://www.asabe.org/join).
- [ ] All team members are required to familiarize themselves with the rules of competition. Last year's handbook and rulebook can be found in the [Additional Resources](4-additional-resources) folder.

This package is designed to provide you with an understanding of the projects, tools, and skills you will need. Ideally new members should aim to complete this package within their first few months (September-November). There is no hard dead-line, but the sooner you finish the sooner you can start contributing to the team! Once you've made it through the tutorials, reach out, and we'll get you started on some real tasks.

All new members are required to read through the information in the [Development](1-development) section. This will get you familiar with the tools and processes we use.

Within the [Systems](2-systems) section, new members are required to read through the [Overview of Projects](2-systems/OverviewOfProjects.md) and should additionally familiarize themselves with any parts of the system they plan to contribute to.

The [Technical Tutorials](3-technical-tutorials) section provides information on the technical skills you will require for working on the tractor. Anyone not familiar with these topics should read them. This section also provides a few practice projects. New members must complete these projects and demonstrate their understanding of the technical skills before they may begin to contribute to tractor. Below outlines the required tutorials depending on their area of focus:

#### Electrical
- [ ] GPIO Expander

#### Software
- [ ] Host a Web Server

> **Note:** If you intend to work on only one particular system, it is not necessarily required that you complete all tutorials. If you have questions regarding which tutorials you should complete, reach out your Team Lead.

There is also an [Additional Resources](4-additional-resources) section with some great resources should you want.

> **Aside:** This new members package is not exhaustive, and there may be a few gaps here and there. Remember, ***the Internet is your friend***. If you don't understand something, google it, check StackOverflow, find a YouTube video, or ask ChatGPT. If you really get stuck you can always reach out to a member of the team, but learning how to find answers on your own is an invaluable skill in industry. We've all been there when you get thrown head-first into a project you know nothing about and feel like your drowning in the overwhelming amount of knowledge you don't have. Just hang in there and take it one uncommented line of code or shitty datasheet at a time.
