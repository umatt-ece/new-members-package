# 1 - Development
This section outlines topics related to the development of electrical & software projects, from tools & techniques to guidelines & standards.

Of course, everyone does their development cycle slightly differently - but that's what this whole section is for. For those of you who are completely new, this section should provide you with an introduction to the general systems, tools, and processes used for electrical/software project development. For those of you already have a grasp on the basics, this section will give you the specifics of how we would like to see things done here at UMATT.
